# Pressure Sensor

The Honeywell 24PC Series miniature pressure sensors provide reliable gage.
Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure that is exerted by a fluid at equilibrium at a given point within the fluid, due to the force of gravity. Hydrostatic pressure increases in proportion to depth measured from the surface because of the increasing weight of fluid exerting downward force from above.

## Piezoresistive pressure sensors

Piezoresistive pressure sensors are among the most common types of pressure sensors. They use the change in electrical resistance of a material when stretched to measure the pressure.

Piezoresistive sensors uses a strain gauge made of metal or a semiconducting material that changes its electrical resistance when it is stretched. The strain gauge can be attached to a diaphragm that recognises a change in resistance when the sensor element is deformed. The change in resistance is converted to an output signal.

## Gauge and Absolute Pressure

When measuring pressure, determining to use gauge or absolute pressure is important

## Units of Pressure

SI unit for pressre is the Pascal, Pa.
Pa = N/m2 (Newton per square meter)
1 bar = 100,000 Pa = 105 Pa
1 atm = 101,325 Pa
1 psi = 6895 Pa
1 torr = 1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa
1 inch of water = 249 Pa (P=œÅgh = 1000 x 9.81 x 0.0254)
P = pgh, P = Pressure, p =density of the liquid, g = acceleration due to gravity, h = height of liquid

Using the sensor sheet it will provide as a guide to choose the which 24PC series is best depend on the pressure proportional to height of the tank.
